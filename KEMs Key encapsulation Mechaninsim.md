# Description 

* [[Introduction a Quantum Safe#KEMs Key encapsulation Mechaninsim]]

Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) in a way that's easy to understand for someone new to the subject.

I. Introduction to Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)
   A. Definition: KEM is a cryptographic protocol used to securely establish a s**hared secret key between two parties over an insecure channel.**

II. How KEM Works
   A. **Key Generation**
      1. The sender generates a **public-private key pair** using a specific mathematical algorithm.
      2. The **public key is shared with the intended recipient**, while the private key is kept secret.

   B. **Key Encapsulation**
      1. The **sender uses the recipient's public key to generate a random symmetric key** (the shared secret key) and **an encapsulated key.**
      2. The **encapsulated key is sent to the recipient over an insecure channel**.

   C. Key **Decapsulation**
      1. The r**ecipient uses their private key to decapsulate the encapsulated key** received from the sender.
      2. This process allows the **recipient to recover the shared secret key**.

   D. Secure **Communication**
      1. **Once both parties have the shared secret key**, they can use it to securely communicate or encrypt data using symmetric-key cryptography.

*The random symmetric key generated during the key encapsulation step and the key obtained after the key decapsulation step are the same. ?*

III. Advantages of KEM
    A. Separates Key Establishment and Data Encryption
       1. KEMs are designed **specifically for secure key establishmen**t, while **data encryption is handled separately using symmetric-key cryptography.**
       2. This separation of concerns allows for more flexibility and potential performance improvements.
	B. Resistance to Quantum Attacks
       1. Some **KEM algorithms, such as those based on lattice-based cryptography, are believed to be resistant to attacks by quantum computers.**
       2. This makes KEMs an attractive choice for future-proofing secure communication systems.
    C. Efficiency and Scalability
       1. KEMs can be more efficient than traditional key exchange methods, especially in scenarios involving a large number of participants.
       2. They can be easily scaled to accommodate different security levels and key sizes.

IV. Examples of KEM Algorithms

    B. CRYSTALS-Kyber (based on lattice-based cryptography)
    C. SIKE (Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation)
